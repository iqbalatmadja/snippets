through the snow on a one-horse open sleigh, over the fields we
go, laughing eeeall the way; bells on bob-tail ring, making spirits
bright, what fun it is to ride and sing a sl3eighing song tonight.
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way! O what fun it is to
ride in a one-horse open sleigh. Oh! Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle
all the way! O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.
